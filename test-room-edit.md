# Room Edit Button Fix Test Instructions

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Added dedicated POST mapping for room updates**: `/property/rooms/{id}`
2. **Enhanced error handling and logging** in room save operations
3. **Updated form action URL** to use the correct endpoint for editing
4. **Added comprehensive logging** to track room operations

## Testing Steps:

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Access property management**:
   - Go to: `http://localhost:8080/property/login`
   - Login: username=`admin`, password=`admin123`

3. **Navigate to rooms**:
   - Click "Rooms" in the navigation
   - You should see sample rooms created automatically

4. **Test the Edit button**:
   - Click "Edit" on any room
   - You should see the room form with populated data
   - Make a change (e.g., update room name)
   - Click "Save"
   - Should redirect back to rooms list with success message

## What Was Fixed:

### Controller Changes:
- Added `@PostMapping("/rooms/{id}")` for explicit room updates
- Enhanced logging to track room operations
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks
- Better validation error reporting

### Template Changes:
- Updated form action to use `/property/rooms/{id}` for edits
- Form now dynamically chooses the correct endpoint

### Expected Behavior:
- **New Room**: Form POSTs to `/property/rooms`
- **Edit Room**: Form POSTs to `/property/rooms/{id}`
- Both operations handled with comprehensive logging

## Debugging:
If issues persist, check the application logs for:
- `Editing room with ID: {id}`
- `Updating room with ID: {id}`  
- `Saving room: ID={id}, RoomNumber={number}`
- Any error messages with stack traces

## Diagnostic Endpoint:
Visit `/property/diagnostic` (after login) to see:
- Authentication status
- Room count
- Sample room data
- System health status
