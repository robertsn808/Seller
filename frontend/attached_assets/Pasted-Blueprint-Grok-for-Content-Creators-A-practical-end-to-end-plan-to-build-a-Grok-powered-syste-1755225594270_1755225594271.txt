2) Core Capabilities (Grok Modules)
1. Trend Radar
• Ingests trending topics, questions, sounds, formats by niche and platform.
• Scores opportunities by relevance × timeliness × competition × creator fit.
2. Audience Brain
• Profiles audience segments (problems, desires, objections).
• Mines comments/DMs to surface pain points and FAQs.
• Creates “content angles” per segment.
3. Content Architect
• Generates briefs: hook, promise, outline, CTA, platform‑specific specs.
• Produces drafts: short‑form scripts (15–60s), long‑form outlines, carousels, captions, email/newsletter variants.
• Repurposes one “pillar” into multi‑format derivatives (video → thread → carousel → newsletter → blog).
4. Creator Voice Engine
• Learns voice/tone from past posts.
• Enforces brand rules (humor level, slang, reading level, do/don’t phrases).
5. SEO & Metadata Genie
• Suggests titles, keywords, tags, thumbnails ideas, hashtags.
• Builds YouTube descriptions, blog H1–H3, schema hints.
6. Publish & Calendar Pilot
• Auto‑creates a content calendar with deadlines.
• Pre‑formats assets per platform limits (length, aspect ratio, text caps).
• Exports to schedulers (Buffer, Later, native platform drafts).
7. Experiment & Feedback Loop
• A/B tests hooks, thumbnails, first 3 seconds.
• Monitors performance; recommends edits, remixes, repost t
