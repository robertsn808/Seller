# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Real Estate Connect is a Spring Boot web application that serves as a funnel for connecting real estate buyers and sellers. The application allows buyers to submit their "buy box" requirements and sellers to list their properties, enabling you to bird-dog deals by matching qualified leads.

## Development Commands

- **Start the application**: `mvn spring-boot:run`
- **Access H2 console**: http://localhost:8080/h2-console (JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb)

### Running with PostgreSQL (Local Production)
- **Start PostgreSQL**: `docker-compose up -d`
- **Start with PostgreSQL**: `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=postgres`
- **Stop PostgreSQL**: `docker-compose down`

### Deployment (Render)
- **Deploy Guide**: See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete Render deployment instructions
- **Live Demo**: Deploy to Render for public access
- **Auto-deploy**: Configured via `render.yaml` blueprint

### General Commands
- **Build the project**: `mvn clean package`
- **Run tests**: `mvn test`

## Database Configuration

### Development (H2)
The application uses H2 in-memory database by default for development. Data is recreated on each restart.

### Production (PostgreSQL)
For persistent data storage, use PostgreSQL:
1. Start PostgreSQL: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Run application: `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=postgres`
3. Database: `seller_funnel` with user `postgres` and password `password`

### File Storage
- Property photos are stored in `uploads/property-photos/` directory
- Access photos via `/photos/{fileName}` endpoint
- Supports JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP formats

## Architecture Notes

This is a Spring MVC web application using Thymeleaf for templating. The architecture follows standard Spring Boot patterns with clearly separated layers (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Entity). Form validation uses Bean Validation annotations, and the H2 console is available for development database access.
